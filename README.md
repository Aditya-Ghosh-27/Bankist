# Bankist Project

## Overview

Welcome to Bankist, a web application project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to simulate a simple banking application where users can manage their accounts, make transactions, and explore the functionality of various JavaScript array methods.

## Features

- **Account Management**: Users can log in to their accounts, view their balance, and perform transactions.
  
- **Transaction History**: The application maintains a transaction history, allowing users to review their past transactions.

- **Array Methods Demonstration**: The project emphasizes the effective use of JavaScript array methods to manipulate and manage data. Key array methods covered include `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `sort`.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout for the web pages.
  
- **CSS**: Styles the HTML elements, ensuring an attractive and user-friendly interface.

- **JavaScript**: Drives the interactivity of the application, manages user data, and extensively utilizes array methods.
